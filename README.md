# sElFmoCk - Discord.js selfbot.

sElFmoCk is a selfbot for Discord written in Discord.js (Node.js). It's quite simple to use.  
The mocking function was taken from York's GuideBot command which you can view [here.](https://github.com/YorkAARGH/York-Dev/blob/e53f14dd931ef09b78c362d880ea5272c90b4f87/commands/mock.js#L4)  

> I am not responsible for any damage that is caused to your Discord account, your system or anything else for that matter. You risk getting your account banned from Discord, as with any other selfbot.  

To install this selfbot, please refer to the Wiki page [here.](https://github.com/Jellz/sElFmoCk/wiki)
