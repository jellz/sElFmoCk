# sElFmoCk - Discord.js selfbot.

sElFmoCk is a selfbot for Discord written in Discord.js (Node.js). It's quite simple to use.  
The mocking function was taken from York's GuideBot command which you can view [here.](https://github.com/YorkAARGH/York-Dev/blob/e53f14dd931ef09b78c362d880ea5272c90b4f87/commands/mock.js#L4)  

## What is this bot?
sElFmoCk allows you to say `mock! (text)` and your **text** will turn to mockified **tExT**, based on the popular Spongebob meme.
For example, if I say `mock! hello bobby`, it would edit to something like `heLlO bObBy`. Ha, quite cool right?
